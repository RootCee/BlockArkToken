# BlockArkToken Contract

The `BlockArkToken` contract is an **ERC20 token contract** with additional features for member and manager roles. The contract is written in Solidity and uses the **OpenZeppelin library** for the ERC20 and Ownable functionality.

## Features

- **ERC20 Token:** The contract creates an ERC20 token with a total supply of 999 tokens.
- **Members and Managers:** The contract has a concept of members and managers. Initially, the addresses provided to the constructor are set as both members and managers.
- **Voting:** Members can vote for other members. The voting power is proportional to the number of tokens the voter holds.
- **Manager Role:** The contract owner can add and remove managers.

## Deployment

To deploy this contract using Remix:

1. Open Remix in your browser.
2. Click on the "File Explorers" icon on the left sidebar, then click on the "+" icon to create a new file. Name it `BlockArkToken.sol`.
3. **Copy and paste the contract code** into this file.
4. Click on the "Solidity Compiler" icon on the left sidebar, select the correct compiler version (0.8.0), and click "Compile BlockArkToken.sol".
5. Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" icon on the left sidebar.
6. In the "Deploy" section, select the `BlockArkToken` contract. In the "value" field, enter the initial member addresses as an array. For example, if you have two initial members with addresses `0xAbc...` and `0xDef...`, you would enter `["0xAbc...", "0xDef..."]`.
7. Click "Deploy".

## Interacting with the Contract

After deployment, you can interact with the contract using the Remix interface, or programmatically using a library like Web3.js or Ethers.js.

Here are some of the **key functions** you can call:

- `vote(address _recipient)`: As a member, vote for another member. The voting power is proportional to the number of tokens you hold.
- `getVotes(address _member)`: Get the number of votes a member has received.
- `addManager(address _manager)`: As the contract owner, add a manager.
- `removeManager(address _manager)`: As the contract owner, remove a manager.

## Backend Integration

To integrate this contract into a backend system, you would typically use a library like Web3.js or Ethers.js. These libraries allow you to interact with Ethereum contracts from JavaScript.

Here's a basic example of how you might initialize the contract using Web3.js:

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID');

const contractABI = [...]; // Contract ABI
const contractAddress = '0x...'; // Contract address

const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);
```

Once you've initialized the contract, you can call its functions. For example, to get the number of votes a member has received:

```javascript
const votes = await contract.methods.getVotes('0x...').call();
console.log(votes);
```

Remember to replace `'0x...'` with the actual member address, and `'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'` with your actual Infura project ID or another Ethereum node URL.
